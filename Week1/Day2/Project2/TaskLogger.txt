Goal: create a gui base python project that sits somewhere on your screen and overlays over whatever your working on...
Features: 
write something down
click a button -> submits time-> total time spent versus last submit task -> to text file/google sheets for logging.

Reason-> keep track of contracting work and time clutter when playing video games and what not. 

Pre based research-? looks up important python based gui applications... 

future notes ( perhaps making a generator for these project write ups ... maybe tomorrow.

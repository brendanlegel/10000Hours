Project: 10000 Hours of Coding

Project Description: 

They say that if you spend 10000 hours doing any task you become an expert at that task... 
Now I have two very particular things I'm interested in becoming an expert in. One is the ability
to program and code, and the second is becoming a master of origami ( quite an odd one I know ). 

In both of these cases I have spent at least 1000 hours on them already, obtaining a would be journeyman's 
level appreciation of the skills needed to become an expert. This can be said from obtaining a degree from
New College Of Florida as a Computer Science and Operations Research double major. I've programmed countless 
scripts and task that when reflecting back on them I'm quite lost in how I ignored proper technique so before I 
move on into the work force my goal is to go back and perfect the very task I set out to do only now in hindsight
I wish to do it better. 

Project Direction:

We will start with python and some basic calculations of how I need to spend my day, then we will go from there.
